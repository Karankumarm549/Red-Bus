# DATA-SCRAPING-WITH-SELENIUM-DYNAMIC-FILTERING-USING-STREAMLIT
## PURPOSE:

- The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" aims to transform the transportation industry by offering a complete solution for gathering, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. Utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, such as bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. By simplifying data collection and providing robust tools for data-driven decision-making, the project has the potential to greatly enhance operational efficiency and support strategic planning in the transportation sector.

# FEATURES OF APPLICATION
## - Retrive the Bus Information:
        - Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, which is especially useful for web scraping tasks. If you want to retrieve bus details from RedBus, 
 you can use Selenium to automate the process of searching for buses and extracting the relevant information. This involves interacting with web elements 
 like input fields and buttons, waiting for the page to load, and extracting the desired details from the search results.

## - Store Data in Database:
         - The collected bus details data was transformed into pandas dataframes. Before that, a new database and tables were created using the MySQL connector. With the help of MySQL, the data was inserted into the respective tables. The database could be accessed and managed in the MySQL environment.

## - Web App - Streamlit:
          - With the help of Streamlit, you can create an interactive application similar to RedBus by designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for bus routes, view available buses, and get details like departure times and prices
